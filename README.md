Cipher Project README
This project is an implementation of a Caesar Cipher in Python, which is a type of substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext message a certain number of places down the alphabet.

The project contains a Jupyter Notebook named "Cipher_Project.ipynb". The notebook contains detailed explanations of the code, the approach used to implement the Caesar Cipher, and how to use it.

Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install Jupyter Notebook, which is a web-based interactive computational environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip, the Python package installer, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
pip install jupyter
Usage
Clone the project repository or download the "Cipher_Project.ipynb" file to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Cipher_Project.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to encrypt or decrypt your message using the Caesar Cipher.
